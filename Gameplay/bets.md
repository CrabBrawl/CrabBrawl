# Bets

Bets can be placed on the crabbrawl website (Or just ingame no clue have to check if the contract allows it or how that shit works). 

When placing a bet you must enter a number of $CRAB u are willing to Stake. Once someone accepts your bet both parties will need to accept a Ready Check ingame. Once that is done they will both be qued into a match. The winning party will receive all the Staked $CRAB from both Crabs besides of a small [fee](Token.md).
