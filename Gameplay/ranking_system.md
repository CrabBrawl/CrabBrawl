# Ranking System

The Ranking System is the second core system to earn $CRAB with the other one being owning a Crab.

The Ranking System has 4 functions:

- Tracking Ranked points
- Dividing Crabs into leagues
- Tracking ranks
- Handing out rewards

Tracking Ranked points:

Ranked points can be earned or lost by playing [Ranked Matches](arena.md). Each won match will award you 15 points while each lost match will deduct 15 points. The Ranking System will keep track of your Ranked points so you can always check how many u currently have.

Dividing Crabs into leagues:

There are X amount of leagues, Crabs will be put into different leagues according to their current Ranked points. 
(Table of leagues and pts required)

Tracking ranks:

Handing out rewards:

Rewards for leagues, Guilwar and ranks will be handed out monthly according to our [Tokenomics](Token.md).
