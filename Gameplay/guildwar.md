# Guildwar

To partake in Guildwars you'll first have to join a Guild.

Guilds can be created by any Crab and can hold up to 20 Crabs

- Guildwars are seasonal with a monthly reset just like the [Ranking System](ranking_system.md)
- Any Guild can sign up for a Guildwar season
- Any Guild will have to reapply to Guildwar after a season has concluded
- Rewards will be given out at the end of each season

Guildwars always happen at predefined times given out by the server. (For example Saturday 8pm) They will also be done on a custom Guildwar map which can't be played on in Matchmaking.
