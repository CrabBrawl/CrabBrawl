# Arena

When logging into Crab Brawl you'll first be put into the Lounge where u can interact with fellow Crab Brawl players, change your Talent Tree, check on your skill and stats and search for Matches.

To partake in the Brawl action you'll have to use the Matchmaking function.

At release there will be 2 different modes: Practise and [Ranked](ranking_system.md).

For these matches there will be Arenas which contain different Themes and enviorments.
