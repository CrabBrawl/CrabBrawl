# Skills

Each class has its own set of skills which can't be used with other weapons. Once a Crab changes their equipped weapon its skills as well as their Talent Tree will be changed according to the weapon they change to.

Most skills have a Cooldown which will last for X turns depending on its Cooldown Timer. This means that some skills can't be used over and over.

Some classes also have stats which are only available to their own class, a example here would be a mage. A mage will have the MP stat which will be depleted when using specific skills. When a mage doesn't have enough MP for a skill it won't be able to cast said skill.

The other classes which have class specific stats are as follows:
