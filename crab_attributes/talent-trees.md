# Talent Trees

The Talent Tree constists of several pathways all of which have different Talents. These pathways and Talents are different for each class. Each Talent must use 3 Talent Points to progress to the next Talent. The maximum amount of Talent points is 51 which does not fill out the Talent Tree but instead the limit of 51 is bound to the Crabs level. 

Talents may include various Passive buffs for your Crab, active buffs for a weapon skill or debuffs which can be inflicted on a enemy crab with a weapon skill.

(Insert Picture with a Talent Tree example)
