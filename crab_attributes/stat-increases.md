# Stat Increases

Regeular Stat Increases scale up your Base Stats by mulitplying them. (Base Stats * Regular Stats). Regular Stats can be acquired through your Crabs Color as well as several ingame upgrades (One example here would be a Global Weapon level on your crab which can be increased by acquiring Material and upgrading your weapon. Levels of said weapons would automatically transfer over when swapping to a different weapon.)
