# Base Stats

Each crab has at least the following base stats:

- Health
- Attack
- Defense
- Crit
- Speed

These stats vary according to the class your crab has which is determined by its weapon.

The only way to increase your base stats is by [leveling](leveling.md) your crab.

Base stats are always used at the very beginning of any damage in or output calculation.
