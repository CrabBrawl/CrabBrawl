# Leveling

The leveling system serves 3 main purposes:

Base stats
Talent Tree points 
Higher APY

Base stats:

Each levelup will increase the crabs base stats by x% until reaching the maximum level of 90.

Talent Tree points:

Talent Tree points will be awarded for every other level, at lvl1 every crab will be given 6 Talent Points thus a maxed level crab will be eligable to allocate 51 points into their Talent Tree.

Higher APY:

For every 10 levels reached the amount of received $CRAB /day will be increased by 1,5. By having a max level crab you'll receive 16 $CRAB /day. 

Option 1: Each Crab starts from level 1 and gains XP by completing their weekly quests.

Option 2: Crabs can gain XP from various activites until reaching the current Global level Cap. This means that if the level CAP is 38 and a Crab reaches level 38 it won't be receiving anymore XP until the Global level CAP has been raised to 39. This is mainly to reduce grinding.
